# Snake Client Project

Snake game is a very popular video game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

If you haven't played snake, you may be young! This was the most popular game on mobile phones back in 2004 and honestly, still one of the best games around! This is my first published game project and second published npm project, so you might be some one that I want to work with, and I would like to thank you for your consideration!

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.
